  title: "Resource Manager"
  description: |
    This is the API specification for the Apollo Resource Manager. The api provides various routes to 
    sign-up/login, manage resources, functions and services, get resources based on Service Level Objectives (SLOs) 
    and automatically deploy and terminate resources. 
    
    ## Resource Types
    - **edge**: Edge resources must have a running instance of OpenFaas to be used for deployment. Only functions can
    be deployed on edge resources.
    - **serverless**: Serverless resources are cloud resources where serverless functions can be deployed. Currently 
    AWS Lambda is the only supported platform. Only functions can be deployed on serverless resources.
    - **vm**: VM resources are virtual machines that can be automatically deployed and terminated by the RM. In the 
    deployment process, an OpenFaas instance is initialised and started on the virtual machines. Only functions can be 
    deployed on edge resources.
    - **container**: Container resources support the deployment of docker images. At the moment kubernetes instances 
    are supported as container resources. Only services can be deployed on edge resources.
    
    ## Metrics
    Metrics are associated with resources and are used for deployment and monitoring. There are two types of metrics:
    - **monitored**: Monitored resources are automatically updated by the monitoring service of the RM (not 
    yet implemented). Examples of this type of metric are price, availability and the heartbeat of a resource.
    - **non monitored**: These are user-set properties that are used primarily for resource deployment. Examples
    for this type of metric are the memory required for serverless functions or the instance type of a virtual machine.
    
  
    Not all resource types support all metrics. The /resource-types/{id}/metrics route can be used to get all metrics 
    that are supported for a particular resource type. The value types for metrics are *string*, *number* and 
    *boolean*.
    
    ## Resources
    Resources consist of a resource type and a region. The *is_self_managed* currently has no functionality.
    It is also possible to add metrics to resources in the form of metric values (see /resources/metrics). For 
    upcoming reservations, it is necessary for a resource to have a metric value for all metrics that are required for
    the resource's metric type. Otherwise the reservation will fail.    
    
    ## Service Level Objectives and Resource Ensembles
    It is possible to retrieve resources filtered by service level objectives (see resources/slo). If you  are 
    satisfied with the resulting resources or if you only need a subset of the retrieved resources you can store them 
    with a name and the service level objectives as a *resource ensemble* (see /ensemble). The resources of the 
    ensemble can be validated with /ensembles/{id}/validate. Supported metrics as service level objectives are all 
    metrics that are managed by the RM as well as resource_type, region and resource_provider. For the latter three 
    properties the values must be the ids of the entities. For example the service level objective for all resource 
    types of type container would look like this:
    
    ```
    {
      name: resource_type,
      expression: "==",
      value: [4]
    }
    ```    
    
    As you can see the type of the value property of the service level objective is array. Therefore, it is possible 
    for service level objectives with the expression '==' to specify multiple values as valid options. For '<' or '>' 
    expressions the value array must be of size one.
    
    ## Functions and Services
    Functions and Services represent the two different deployable entities in the context of the rm. They don't have 
    the same structure and are only available for deployment on predefined resource types as described in the 
    resource types section.
    - **functions**: Function entities consist of a name, a runtime and a function code that can be executed by that 
    runtime. Currently python3.8 is the only supported runtime.
    - **services**: Service entities consist of a name, the title of the docker image, the number of replicas for that 
    service, the ports that should be exposed, the required cpu amount, the required memory amount and the k8s 
    service type. Currently only *NodePort* and *LoadBalancer* are supported service types.    
    
    ## Reservations / Deployment
    Reservations consist of mappings of functions and services to resources and the necessary credentials. 
    - **Credentials**: If deployment to a cloud provider is part of the reserve resource request, credentials (access 
    token, secret token, session token) must be stored on the account (see /credentials). In addition if the 
    request contains resources of type *VM* or *Edge*, docker credentials must also be included in the request, 
    because OpenFaas uses docker images which must first be pushed to a docker repository and then pulled on the 
    concerning resources. Make sure to generate a docker access token with read and write permissions for this 
    purpose. For resources of type *container* a valid kube config must be provided within the request. The kube 
    config must meet some specific requirements:
      1. The cluster array must contain the cluster(s) where you want to deploy images to. 
      2. You must provide a valid context for each cluster. The context must contain the namespace to be used. If this
        is not the case, the RM will use the *default* namespace. 
      3. The certificate and client key data must be inserted directly into the kube config. To do this, you 
      need to base64 encode the two files as values and use *client-certificate-data* and *client-key-data* as keys.
    
    A sample kube config looks like this:
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    clusters:
      - cluster:
          certificate-authority-data: <b64-encdoded-cert-authority-data>
          server: <cluster-url>
        name: clustername
    contexts:
      - context:
          cluster: clustername
          namespace: <your-namespace>
          user: username
        name: <context-name>
    kind: Config
    preferences: {}
    users:
      - name: username
        user:
          client-certificate-data: <b64-encoded-cert>
          client-key-data: <b64-encoded-key>
    ```
    - **Virtual Private Clouds**: In order to deploy virtual machines on AWS a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) must be 
    registered (see /vpcs) prior to submitting a reservation request for each region in which a virtual machine will
    be deployed. 
    - **Output and Status**: After successfully submitting a reserve resource request, a reservation will be created 
    with the status *NEW*. This indicates that the deployment of resources has started but is still in progress. After 
    the RM has completed all tasks associated with the new reservation, the status is changed to **DEPLOYED** and 
    the trigger url is set for all deployed resources. All function-resources and service-resources associated to the 
    reservation can be retrieved with the GET /reservations/{id} request where the newly set trigger urls can be found. 
    For function deployments the trigger url is the function's entrypoint. For service deployments the trigger url 
    starts up the container. The trigger url for service deployments is a endpoint of the RM 
    /reservations/{reservationId}/{resourceReservationId}/deploy. It is also possible to stop the container with 
    the endpoint /reservations/{reservationId}/{resourceReservationId}/terminate. 
    When a reservation is cancelled, the status is changed to *TERMINATING*. After the termination 
    of all the resources associated with the reservation, the status changes to *TERMINATED*. If an error occurs in
    any of these steps, the status is set to *ERROR*. In order to observe what has happened during the deployment and 
    termination, it is possible to retrieve logs for each reservation using the /reservations/{id}/logs endpoint.
    
    
    ## Authentication
    The RM uses **Bearer tokens** for authentication because it's a simple authentication method. 
    New users can be created using the *accounts/signup* route. A new token can be retrieved using the *accounts/login*
    route.  
    
    ## Note 
    Please be aware that the API provided is in the early stages of development and is subject to change in the near
    future. As the development progresses, updates and improvements may be made to the API, including modifications 
    to the structure, behavior, or available functionality. These changes could potentially impact the integration 
    and usage of the API in your application.
    
    Most routes of the API implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. For details, see the
